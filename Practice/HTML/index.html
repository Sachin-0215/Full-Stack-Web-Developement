      <b>Bitcoin</b> <strong>blockchain</strong> structure[further explanation needed] A blockchain is a
      type of <mark>distributed ledger technology (DLT)</mark> that consists of growing list
      of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using
      cryptography. <sub>[1][2][3][4]</sub> 
      Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the
      previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented
      as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). 
      <br>The
      timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was
      created. Since each block contains information about the previous block,
      they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with
      each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently,
      blockchain transactions are <del>irreversible </del > reverse  in that, once they are recorded,
      the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without
      altering all subsequent blocks.
